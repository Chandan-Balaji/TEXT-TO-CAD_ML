ADDITIONAL CONTEXT TO INCLUDE:

The project has two versions:
1. Original Linux-based Python implementation with FreeCAD
2. Web-based demo using Three.js (currently working)

Current Status:
- All Python packages installed on Windows
- FreeCAD 1.0.2 installed but Python integration pending
- Web demo fully functional at localhost:8000
- NO training has been completed yet
- NO trained model exists yet
- Web app uses basic pattern matching, not AI

The trained model (when created) would:
- Use PyTorch neural network
- Train on 500k+ synthetic examples
- Convert text → shape parameters
- Support sphere, cube, cylinder, cone, torus
- Output: shape type, dimensions, position, rotation, color
